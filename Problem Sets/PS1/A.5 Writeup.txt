1. What were your results from compare_cow_trasport_algorithms?  Which algorithm runs faster? Why?

The greedy algorithm took 0.01 seconds to run and found a solution that requires six trips.  The brute force algorithm took 1.02 seconds to
find a solution requiring five trips; the optimal solution.  The greedy alg runs faster because it only iterates over the list t times where
t is the number of trips it finds to be optimal. The brute force alg on the other hand, iterates over every possible combination of cows
which is far greater than t.


2. Does the greedy alg return the optimal solution? Why/why not?

The greedy alg doens't return the optimal solution.  It finds the locally optimal solution for each iteration which, in this case, doesn't result in the 
globally optimal solution.


3. Does the brute force algorithm return the optimal solution? Why/why not?

Yes. The brute force alg searches through every combination of cows comparing each against each other.  Therefore the solution it finds must be the optimal 
one.
